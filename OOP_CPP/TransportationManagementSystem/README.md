# Transportation Management System
## How it works?
The program implements **OOP** in order to create classes of transports, cities, and branches which will be connected to each other using **HASA relationship** between classes and **virtual functions**.

In the beginning, the system is empty and the user can create branches, along with the number of cars, buses, car models, etc.
The user can request different pieces of information afterwards, when the system has been created.

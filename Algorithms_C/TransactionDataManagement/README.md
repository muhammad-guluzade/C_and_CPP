# Transaction Data Management
## How it works?

In the beginning, the program reads a file that contains a **list of transactions**. It then creates a **structure array (customers)** and gives the user an a choice to **sort the customers according to different data present in the data structure**. All of the sorting is done using **heap sorting algorithm**.
